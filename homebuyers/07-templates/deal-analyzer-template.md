### ARV Formula

**Standard ARV Calculation:**
```
ARV = (Comp1_Adjusted + Comp2_Adjusted + Comp3_Adjusted) / 3

Where:
- Comp_Adjusted = Comp_Sale_Price + Size_Adjustment + Condition_Adjustment + Feature_Adjustment + Location_Adjustment + Market_Timing_Adjustment
```

**ARV Range:**
- Conservative ARV: [Low end of range]
- Most Likely ARV: [Middle of range]
- Optimistic ARV: [High end of range]
- **Use Conservative ARV for MAO**
