## Intro

The Workflow Template provides a standardized format for documenting workflows, including visual flowcharts, swimlane mappings, and SLA tracking. This template ensures consistent workflow documentation that enables clear process understanding, bottleneck identification, and continuous improvement.

## Purpose

Provide a reusable template for documenting workflows with visual elements, process flows, and performance tracking. This enables effective workflow documentation and optimization.

## When This Applies

- Documenting new workflows
- Updating existing workflows
- Visualizing process flows
- Identifying bottlenecks
- Optimizing workflows

### Flowchart (ASCII or Visual)

```
[Start] → [Step 1] → [Decision Point?]
                    ↓ Yes          ↓ No
              [Step 2A]      [Step 2B]
                    ↓              ↓
              [Step 3] ←───────────┘
                    ↓
              [Step 4] → [End]
```

### Swimlane Mapping

| Role/Team | Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 | Step 4 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Lead Management** | [Action] | [Action] | | |
| **Acquisitions** | | [Action] | [Action] | |
| **Dispositions** | | | | [Action] |
| **Operations** | [Support] | [Support] | [Support] | [Support] |

### SLA Fields

| Stage | SLA | Owner | Measurement |
|-------|-----|-------|-------------|
| Step 1 | [Time] | [Role] | [How measured] |
| Step 2 | [Time] | [Role] | [How measured] |
| Step 3 | [Time] | [Role] | [How measured] |
| **Total** | [Time] | | |

### Decision Points

**Decision Point 1: [Decision Name]**
- **Question:** [What is being decided]
- **Criteria:** [Decision criteria]
- **Yes Path:** [What happens if yes]
- **No Path:** [What happens if no]

**Decision Point 2: [Decision Name]**
- [Repeat structure]

### Handoff Points

**Handoff 1: [From] → [To]**
- **Trigger:** [What triggers handoff]
- **Deliverable:** [What is handed off]
- **SLA:** [Time requirement]
- **Information:** [What information is included]

**Handoff 2: [From] → [To]**
- [Repeat structure]

## Tools Used

- **Workflow Mapping Tools**: Visual flowchart creation
- **Swimlane Tools**: Process mapping
- **Documentation System**: Workflow storage
- **Process Analytics**: Performance tracking

## Role Responsibilities

**Process Owners**
- Document workflows using template
- Create visual flowcharts
- Define SLAs and handoffs
- Maintain workflow accuracy

**Team Members**
- Follow workflows
- Provide feedback
- Suggest improvements
- Report issues

**Operations**
- Ensure template usage
- Monitor workflow performance
- Optimize workflows
- Support documentation

## KPIs or SLAs

- **Workflow Completeness**: 100% include all required elements
- **Workflow Accuracy**: 95%+ accurate
- **Workflow Adherence**: High adherence rates
- **Workflow Performance**: Meets SLA targets

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Documenting New Workflow**
Process owner uses template to document new workflow. Creates flowchart, defines swimlanes, sets SLAs. Workflow reviewed, approved, published. Team follows workflow consistently.

**Scenario 2: Optimizing Workflow**
Workflow performance below targets. Process owner reviews workflow, identifies bottlenecks using template structure. Redesigns workflow, updates documentation. Performance improves.

**Scenario 3: Workflow Visualization**
Team needs to understand complex workflow. Process owner creates visual flowchart using template. Team reviews, understands flow better. Workflow comprehension improved.
