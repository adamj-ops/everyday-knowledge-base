| 1 | [Address] | $[Price] | [Sq Ft] | $[PSF] | [Date] | [Adjust] | $[Value] |
| 2 | [Address] | $[Price] | [Sq Ft] | $[PSF] | [Date] | [Adjust] | $[Value] |
| 3 | [Address] | $[Price] | [Sq Ft] | $[PSF] | [Date] | [Adjust] | $[Value] |

**ARV Calculation:**
- Average Adjusted Value: $[Amount]
- ARV Range: $[Low] - $[High]
- **Conservative ARV:** $[Amount] (used for MAO)
- **Methodology:** [How calculated]

### Repair Cost Estimate Section

**Repair Categories:**

Less: Holding Costs          $[Amount]
Less: Desired Profit          $[Amount]
Less: Closing Costs           $[Amount]

```

**Profit Analysis:**
- Purchase Price (at MAO): $[Amount]
