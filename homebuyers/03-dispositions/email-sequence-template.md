## Intro

The Email Sequence Template provides a structured series of emails for communicating with buyers throughout the sales process, from initial property introduction through closing. This sequence ensures consistent, timely communication that keeps buyers engaged and moves deals forward efficiently. Effective email sequences increase response rates, generate more offers, and improve buyer satisfaction.

## Purpose

Establish a standardized email sequence that guides buyers through the sales process with timely, relevant communications. This ensures no buyer falls through the cracks and all buyers receive consistent, professional communication.

## When This Applies

- Sending new property opportunities to buyers
- Following up with buyers after initial outreach
- Managing buyer communication throughout sales process
- Ensuring consistent buyer engagement
- Optimizing email communication effectiveness
