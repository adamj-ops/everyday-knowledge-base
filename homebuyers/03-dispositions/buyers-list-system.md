## Intro

The Buyers List System is a curated database of cash buyers who purchase properties from us. This system enables efficient property marketing, targeted buyer outreach, and relationship management. A well-maintained buyers list is critical for quick sales at optimal prices, as it provides a ready market for our properties without the delays and costs of traditional marketing.

## Purpose

Document the buyers list system structure, management processes, and best practices. This ensures consistent buyer data quality, effective buyer matching, and strong relationship management.

## When This Applies

- Matching buyers to properties
- Managing buyer relationships
- Analyzing buyer performance
- Optimizing buyers list effectiveness
