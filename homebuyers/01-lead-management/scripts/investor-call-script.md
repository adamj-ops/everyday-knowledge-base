## Intro

Investor leads require a different approach than owner-occupant leads, as investors have different motivations, decision-making processes, and expectations. This script provides specialized guidance for qualifying and working with investors who own rental properties, flip properties, or other investment real estate. The approach focuses on business efficiency, ROI, and straightforward transactions.

## Purpose

Provide a specialized script and framework for handling investor leads effectively. Investors value speed, efficiency, and clear communication, so the script emphasizes these aspects while qualifying for viable opportunities.

## When This Applies

- Contacting leads identified as investment property owners
- Homeowners mention they own multiple properties
- Re-engaging leads who previously mentioned investment properties
- Training team members on investor communication

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### Investor Profile Understanding

**Common Investor Types:**
- **Rental Property Owners**: Own properties for rental income
- **House Flippers**: Buy, renovate, and sell properties
- **Wholesalers**: Assign contracts to other investors
- **Portfolio Owners**: Own multiple properties as business
- **Accidental Landlords**: Inherited or kept property as rental

**Investor Motivations:**
- Maximize ROI and profit
- Minimize time and hassle
- Exit underperforming properties
- Free up capital for better opportunities
- Simplify portfolio management

### Script Approach

**Tone Guidelines:**
- **Business-focused**: Speak their language, focus on ROI
- **Efficient**: Respect their time, get to the point
- **Straightforward**: No emotional appeals, just facts
- **Professional**: Treat as business transaction
- **Confident**: Show expertise and competence

### Investor-Specific Script

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Everyday Homebuyers. I'm calling because I understand you own [property type/number] investment properties. We work with investors like yourself who want to sell properties quickly and efficiently. Is now a good time for a quick conversation?"

**Value Proposition:**
"We buy investment properties for cash, close quickly - usually 7-14 days - and handle all the details. No need to deal with tenants, repairs, or the hassle of listing. We make the process simple and straightforward so you can free up capital and move on to your next opportunity."

**Qualification Questions:**

**Property Portfolio:**
- "How many properties do you currently own?"
- "What types of properties - single family, multi-family, commercial?"
- "Are you looking to sell one property or multiple?"

**Motivation:**
- "What's driving your decision to sell - underperforming property, need capital, simplifying portfolio?"
- "Are you looking to exit this property to invest elsewhere?"
- "What would make this a successful transaction for you?"

**Property Condition:**
- "What's the current condition of the property?"
- "Are there tenants in place, or is it vacant?"
- "What kind of repairs or updates does it need?"

**Timeline & Expectations:**
- "What's your ideal timeline for selling?"
- "What are you hoping to get for the property?"
- "Have you had it appraised or gotten other offers?"

**Decision-Making:**
- "Are you ready to move forward if we can meet your needs?"
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "What would need to happen for you to accept an offer?"

**Script Flow:**

**If Rental Property:**
"I understand this is a rental property. Many investors we work with are looking to exit underperforming rentals or free up capital. We can close quickly, even with tenants in place, and you can walk away clean. Does that sound like something that might work for you?"

**If Flip Property:**
"I see you're in the flipping business. Sometimes flippers have properties that didn't work out as planned, or they want to move capital to a better opportunity. We can make you a cash offer and close fast so you can redeploy that capital. Is that the situation you're in?"

**If Portfolio Owner:**
"I understand you own multiple properties. Are you looking to sell one specific property, or are you considering selling multiple? We can work with you on individual properties or put together a package deal if that makes sense."

### Objection Handling

**"I can get more listing it"**
- "You're absolutely right - you might get more listing it. The question is: is the extra money worth the time, hassle, repairs, staging, showings, and uncertainty? We offer speed, certainty, and simplicity. For many investors, that's worth more than the potential extra profit. What's more valuable to you - maximum price or maximum efficiency?"

**"I need to get X amount"**
- "I understand you have a number in mind. We base our offers on current market value minus repairs and our standard margin. Let me have our acquisitions team analyze the property and give you a real number. If it works, great. If not, you'll at least know where you stand. Fair enough?"

**"I'm not in a hurry"**
- "That's fine - we can work with your timeline. Some investors choose us for the simplicity and certainty, even if they're not in a rush. Would you like to see what we could offer, just to have as an option?"

**"I'm working with a wholesaler"**
- "Wholesalers can be great, but they often require you to do a lot of the work, and there's no guarantee they'll find a buyer. We're the end buyer - we close directly with you, no middleman. It's simpler and more certain. Would you like to see what we could offer?"

### Key Differentiators for Investors
