## Intro

The Qualification Script guides SARs through the systematic process of determining if a lead represents a viable opportunity worth pursuing. This script ensures consistent qualification criteria are applied, all necessary information is gathered, and qualified leads are properly routed to the Acquisitions team. Effective qualification maximizes deal flow while minimizing time spent on non-viable opportunities.

## Purpose

Provide a structured script and framework for qualifying leads consistently and efficiently. This ensures all viable opportunities are identified and routed appropriately, while non-viable leads are handled gracefully without wasting team resources.

## When This Applies

- After initial introduction with a new lead
- Re-qualifying leads that have been in pipeline
- Training new SARs on qualification process
- Standardizing qualification approach across team

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### Qualification Framework

**CRITERIA Framework:**
- **C**ondition: Property condition and repair needs
- **R**eason: Seller's motivation and situation
- **I**nterest: Level of interest in selling
- **T**imeline: When they need to sell
- **E**xpectations: Price expectations and flexibility
- **R**eadiness: Are they ready to make a decision
- **I**nvestment: Is this an investment property
- **A**ddress: Property location and details

### Qualification Questions

**Property Condition**
- "Can you tell me about the condition of the property? What kind of repairs or updates does it need?"
- "When was the last time major systems were updated - roof, HVAC, plumbing, electrical?"
- "Are there any major issues I should know about - foundation, water damage, etc.?"

**Seller Motivation**
- "What's motivating you to sell at this time?"
- "Is there a specific deadline or timeline you're working with?"
- "Have you tried selling before, or is this your first time considering it?"

**Interest Level**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how serious are you about selling right now?"
- "What would need to happen for you to move forward with selling?"
- "Are you exploring other options, or is this your primary focus?"

**Timeline**
- "When would you ideally like to have this sold?"
- "Is there a specific date you need to close by?"
- "How flexible is your timeline?"

**Price Expectations**
- "What are you hoping to get for the property?"
- "Have you had it appraised or gotten any other offers?"
- "What's the most important thing to you - price, speed, or simplicity?"

**Decision-Making**
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "What would need to happen for you to accept an offer?"
- "Are you ready to move forward if we can meet your needs?"

**Property Details**
- "Can you confirm the property address?"
- "What's the square footage and number of bedrooms/bathrooms?"
- "When did you acquire the property, and what did you pay?"

### Qualification Decision Tree

**QUALIFIED - Route to Acquisitions if:**
- Property in target market area
- Seller is motivated (needs to sell, has timeline, or wants simplicity)
- Property condition is assessable (not too damaged, not perfect turnkey)
- Estimated ARV suggests profit potential
- Seller is ready to make decision if offer meets needs

**NOT QUALIFIED - Close gracefully if:**
- Property outside target market
- Seller not motivated (just exploring, no timeline)
- Property too damaged (major structural issues, extensive repairs)
- Property is perfect turnkey (better suited for traditional sale)
- Unrealistic price expectations that won't align with market

**NEEDS FOLLOW-UP - Schedule follow-up if:**
- Seller interested but not ready yet (future timeline)
- Need more information to qualify
- Waiting on other factors (other offers, family decisions, etc.)

### Script Flow

**Opening Transition:**
"Great! I'd love to learn more about your situation to see if we might be a good fit. Can I ask you a few questions?"

**Question Sequence:**
1. Start with easy questions (property address, basic details)
2. Move to motivation and timeline (most important)
3. Discuss property condition
4. Explore price expectations
5. Assess readiness and decision-making

**Closing:**
- If Qualified: "Based on what you've told me, I think we might be able to help. Let me get your information to our acquisitions team, and they'll analyze your property and get you an offer. How does that sound?"
- If Not Qualified: "I appreciate you taking the time to talk with me. Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [reason] might not be the best fit right now. If your situation changes, please feel free to reach out. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
- If Needs Follow-Up: "I understand you're not quite ready yet. When do you think you might be ready to move forward? I'd love to follow up with you then. Can I get your contact information so I can reach out?"

## Tools Used

- Route qualified leads promptly

**Lead Management Lead**

## KPIs or SLAs

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Highly Qualified Lead**
SAR asks qualification questions. Homeowner needs to sell due to job relocation in 30 days, property needs $15k in repairs, realistic about price, ready to move forward. SAR qualifies immediately, enters all data, routes to Acquisitions within 30 minutes.

**Scenario 2: Borderline Qualification**
Homeowner interested but not urgent, property in good condition, price expectations high. SAR determines property might be better for traditional sale but qualifies anyway to let Acquisitions evaluate. Routes with note about expectations.

**Scenario 3: Not Qualified**
Homeowner just exploring options, no timeline, property in perfect condition, wants top dollar. SAR gracefully explains we focus on motivated sellers, thanks them for time, offers to follow up if situation changes.
