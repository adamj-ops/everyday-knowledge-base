## Intro

The Intro Script provides the standardized opening and introduction used when making first contact with a new lead. This script ensures consistent, professional communication that builds trust, clearly explains who we are and what we do, and sets the stage for effective qualification. The script is flexible enough to adapt to different situations while maintaining core messaging and tone.

## Purpose

Establish a consistent, effective introduction that every SAR uses when contacting new leads. This ensures professional communication, clear value proposition delivery, and optimal first impressions that lead to higher qualification and conversion rates.

## When This Applies

- First contact with any new lead (inbound or outbound)
- Re-introduction when re-engaging old leads
- Training new SARs on proper introduction technique
- Refreshing introduction approach based on performance data

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### Script Structure

**Opening (0-10 seconds)**
- Greeting and name confirmation
- Company introduction
- Reason for calling

**Value Proposition (10-30 seconds)**
- What we do (buy houses for cash)
- Key benefits (fast, fair, no repairs needed)
- How we're different

**Transition to Qualification (30-45 seconds)**
- Permission to ask questions
- Set expectations for conversation
- Begin qualification process

### Full Script

**Opening:**
"Hi [Homeowner Name], this is [Your Name] calling from Everyday Homebuyers. I'm calling because [reason: you submitted a form / you own a property at X address / referral from Y]. Is now a good time for a quick conversation?"

**If Yes - Continue:**
"Great! We're a local company that buys houses for cash. We help homeowners who need to sell quickly, don't want to deal with repairs, or just want a simple, straightforward sale process. Does that sound like something you might be interested in?"

**If No - Schedule:**
"No problem, I understand you're busy. When would be a better time to call? I'm available [times]. Or I can send you a quick text with some information if that's easier."

**Value Proposition (if continuing):**
"We make cash offers on houses in any condition - no need for repairs, cleaning, or staging. We can close in as little as 7-14 days, which is much faster than traditional sales. And we handle all the paperwork and details, so it's really simple for you."

**Transition:**
"I'd love to learn a bit more about your situation to see if we might be a good fit. Can I ask you a few quick questions?"

### Tone Guidelines

- **Warm and Friendly**: Smile while talking, use positive language
- **Confident but Not Pushy**: Know your value, but respect their time
- **Empathetic**: Listen to their situation, show understanding
- **Professional**: Maintain business-appropriate tone
- **Enthusiastic**: Show genuine interest in helping them

### Common Responses & Handling

**"I'm not interested"**
- "I completely understand. Can I ask - is it just not the right time, or is there something specific that doesn't sound appealing?"
- Listen to objection, address if possible, or gracefully exit

**"How did you get my number?"**
- "We [source: found your property through public records / you submitted a form / were referred by X]. We only contact property owners who might benefit from our service."
- Be transparent and honest

**"I need to think about it"**
- "Absolutely, I understand this is a big decision. What questions can I answer to help you think it through?"
- Offer to send information, schedule follow-up

**"I'm working with a real estate agent"**
- "That's great! We work alongside agents sometimes. We can make an offer that you can compare with your agent's approach. Would you be open to seeing what we could offer?"

### Objection Handling

**"Your offer will be too low"**
- "I understand that concern. We base our offers on the current market value minus the cost of repairs and our standard profit margin. We're happy to show you our analysis so you can see exactly how we arrived at the number. Would that be helpful?"

**"I don't need to sell quickly"**
- "That's perfectly fine! We can work with your timeline. Some homeowners choose us for the simplicity and certainty, even if they're not in a rush. Would you like to see what we could offer, just to have as an option?"

**"I want to list with an agent"**
- "That's a great option! We're not trying to replace that. We're just another option to consider. Some homeowners like having a cash offer in hand when they list, or they compare our offer to what they might get after agent fees and repairs. Would you be open to seeing our offer?"
