## Intro

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define the timeframes and standards for handling leads at each stage of the lifecycle. These SLAs ensure rapid response times, consistent service quality, and optimal conversion rates. Adhering to SLAs is critical for maintaining competitive advantage, building trust with homeowners, and maximizing deal flow.

## Purpose

Establish clear SLA rules for lead handling at every stage, including response times, action completion deadlines, and escalation procedures. These rules ensure consistent performance and enable accountability.

## When This Applies

- Processing new leads
- Managing lead follow-ups
- Monitoring team performance
- Identifying SLA violations
- Optimizing response times

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### SLA Rules by Stage

**Stage: New → Contacted**
- **SLA**: 5 minutes for inbound leads, 24 hours for outbound leads
- **Action**: First contact attempt (call, SMS, or email)
- **Measurement**: Time from lead entry to first contact attempt
- **Escalation**: If not met, alert Lead Management Lead immediately

**Stage: Contacted → Qualified**
- **SLA**: 1 hour from qualification decision to routing
- **Action**: Complete qualification, enter data, route to Acquisitions
- **Measurement**: Time from qualification decision to Acquisitions assignment
- **Escalation**: If not met, SAR must complete immediately or escalate

**Stage: Qualified → Underwriting**
- **SLA**: Acquisitions acknowledges receipt within 1 hour, begins underwriting within 4 hours
- **Action**: Acknowledge lead assignment, begin underwriting process
- **Measurement**: Time from routing to underwriting start
- **Escalation**: If not met, alert Acquisitions Manager

**Stage: Underwriting → Offer**
- **SLA**: 24-48 hours for standard properties, 72 hours for complex properties
- **Action**: Complete underwriting, generate offer, present to homeowner
- **Measurement**: Time from underwriting start to offer presentation
- **Escalation**: If approaching deadline, escalate to Acquisitions Manager for support

**Stage: Offer → Response**
- **SLA**: Homeowner response expected within 24-72 hours, follow-up if no response
- **Action**: Present offer, set response deadline, follow up if needed
- **Measurement**: Time from offer presentation to homeowner response or follow-up
- **Escalation**: If no response after 72 hours, escalate for re-engagement strategy

**Stage: Negotiation → Closing**
- **SLA**: Negotiation should conclude within 7 days, escalate if stalled
- **Action**: Active negotiation, document progress, finalize terms
- **Measurement**: Time in Negotiation stage
- **Escalation**: If stalled > 7 days, escalate to manager for resolution strategy

**Stage: Closing → Closed**
- **SLA**: Closing completed within 14-30 days of acceptance
- **Action**: Coordinate closing process, resolve issues, complete transaction
- **Measurement**: Time from acceptance to closing completion
- **Escalation**: If delays occur, escalate to Operations Manager

### Priority Levels

**Priority 1 (Immediate)**
- Inbound web form leads
- Referrals from key partners
- High-value properties (>$200k ARV)
- Foreclosure situations with deadlines
- **SLA**: All standard SLAs cut in half

**Priority 2 (Standard)**
- Standard inbound leads
- Cold outreach leads
- Typical property values
- **SLA**: Standard SLAs apply

**Priority 3 (Follow-Up)**
- Leads not immediately ready to sell
- Long-term opportunities
- **SLA**: Extended timelines, regular check-ins

### Escalation Procedures

**Level 1: Team Member**
- Identify SLA risk or violation
- Take immediate action to resolve
- Document issue and resolution

**Level 2: Team Lead/Manager**
- Escalate if unable to resolve within SLA
- Provide context and attempted solutions
- Request support or resources needed

**Level 3: Operations Manager**
- Escalate systemic issues or repeated violations
- Request process improvements or resource allocation
- Coordinate cross-team solutions

## Tools Used

- **Airtable CRM**: SLA tracking fields and automation
- **SLA Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of SLA compliance
- **Alert System**: Automated notifications for SLA risks
- **Performance Reports**: Weekly SLA compliance reports

## Role Responsibilities

**SARs**
- Meet New → Contacted SLA (5 min / 24 hr)
- Meet Contacted → Qualified SLA (1 hr)
- Escalate immediately if SLA cannot be met

**Acquisitions Team**
- Meet Underwriting → Offer SLA (24-48 hr)
- Meet Offer → Response follow-up SLA (72 hr)
- Escalate stalled negotiations (>7 days)

**Operations**
- Monitor SLA compliance across all stages
- Generate SLA performance reports
- Identify and resolve systemic SLA issues
- Optimize processes to improve SLA performance

## KPIs or SLAs

- **Overall SLA Compliance**: 95%+ of leads meet SLAs
- **Response Time**: 100% of Priority 1 leads meet 5-minute SLA
- **Stage Transition Time**: Average time within SLA limits
- **Escalation Rate**: < 5% of leads require escalation
- **SLA Improvement**: Quarterly reduction in average response times

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Inbound Lead SLA**
Web form submitted at 3:15 PM. SAR receives notification, reviews details, calls homeowner at 3:18 PM (3 minutes, within 5-minute SLA). Conversation qualifies lead, routes to Acquisitions by 3:45 PM (27 minutes, well within 1-hour SLA).

**Scenario 2: SLA Risk Alert**
Lead in Underwriting stage for 40 hours (approaching 48-hour SLA). System alerts Acquisitions Specialist, who escalates to Acquisitions Manager. Manager provides support, offer completed and presented at 46 hours (within SLA).

**Scenario 3: Escalation for Stalled Negotiation**
Lead in Negotiation stage for 9 days. Acquisitions Specialist escalates to Manager. Manager reviews situation, determines homeowner needs more time but is still interested. Sets new deadline, documents exception, continues negotiation.
