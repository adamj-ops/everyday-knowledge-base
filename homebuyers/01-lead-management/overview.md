## Intro

Lead Management is the foundation of the Everyday Homebuyers operation, responsible for generating, qualifying, and routing leads through the acquisition pipeline. This function ensures a steady flow of qualified opportunities by systematically managing inbound and outbound lead sources, maintaining rapid response times, and applying consistent qualification criteria. The lead management process directly impacts deal volume, conversion rates, and overall business performance.

## Purpose

Provide a comprehensive overview of the lead management function, including lead sources, qualification processes, lifecycle stages, and how leads flow into the acquisitions pipeline. This document serves as the entry point for understanding how we generate and manage opportunities.

## When This Applies

- Understanding the lead generation and qualification process
- Onboarding new SARs or lead management team members
- Analyzing lead performance and conversion metrics
- Optimizing lead sources and qualification criteria
- Troubleshooting lead flow issues

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### Lead Sources

4. **Social Media**: Facebook, Instagram, and other platform advertising
5. **Cold Outreach**: Proactive contact with potential sellers
6. **Repeat Sellers**: Previous customers and their referrals

### Lead Lifecycle Stages

1. **New**: Lead enters system, initial data captured
2. **Contacted**: First contact attempt made (call, SMS, email)
3. **Qualified**: Lead meets criteria and is routed to Acquisitions
4. **Underwriting**: Acquisitions team evaluates property
5. **Offer**: Offer generated and presented
6. **Negotiation**: Terms being negotiated
7. **Closing**: Deal in closing process
8. **Closed**: Deal completed or lost

### Qualification Criteria

- Property location in target markets

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Inbound Web Form Lead**
Homeowner submits web form at 2:00 PM. SAR receives notification, reviews property details, calls homeowner at 2:03 PM. After 15-minute conversation, determines property is qualified. Enters all data into CRM and routes to Acquisitions team by 2:30 PM.

**Scenario 2: Cold Outreach Lead**
SAR identifies potential seller through public records (probate, foreclosure). Makes initial contact, introduces company, qualifies situation. Property meets criteria, seller is motivated. Lead entered into CRM and routed to Acquisitions.

**Scenario 3: Referral Lead**
Real estate agent refers homeowner who needs to sell quickly. SAR contacts homeowner, explains our process, qualifies property. Property is in good condition but seller needs fast close. Lead qualified and routed with priority flag.
