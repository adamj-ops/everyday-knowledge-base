## When This Applies

- Daily operations for SARs and lead management team

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: High-Volume Day**
Monday morning shows 25 new inbound leads from weekend. SAR prioritizes these, responds to all within 5-minute SLA, qualifies 8, routes to Acquisitions. Then proceeds with scheduled follow-ups and outbound calls. Ends day with 65 contacts made, 12 qualified leads routed.

**Scenario 2: Low-Volume Day**
Fewer new leads, so SAR focuses on outbound prospecting, deep qualification of existing leads, and pipeline cleanup. Completes administrative tasks, updates documentation, and prepares for busier days ahead.

**Scenario 3: SLA Risk Day**
Multiple leads approaching SLA deadlines. SAR prioritizes these, completes all urgent items, then returns to standard workflow. Documents any delays and escalates if needed.
