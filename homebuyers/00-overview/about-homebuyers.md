## Intro

Everyday Homebuyers is the core acquisition and disposition workstream responsible for identifying, underwriting, acquiring, and selling residential real estate properties. This workstream operates as a high-velocity, data-driven operation focused on generating consistent deal flow and maximizing returns through systematic processes. Team members use standardized workflows, CRM tools, and automation to manage leads from initial contact through property disposition, ensuring every interaction meets our best-on-block operational standards.

## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Everyday Homebuyers workstream, its mission, operational model, and how it fits within the broader organization. It serves as the entry point for new team members, stakeholders, and partners who need to understand our business model, processes, and expectations.

## When This Applies

- Onboarding new team members to the Homebuyers workstream
- Providing context to stakeholders about our operations
- Establishing baseline understanding before diving into specific processes
- Reference point for understanding organizational structure and roles

## Process / Framework / Workflow

The Everyday Homebuyers workstream follows a systematic approach:

1. **Lead Generation & Management**: Continuous inbound and outbound lead generation through multiple channels
2. **Qualification & Assessment**: Rapid qualification of leads to identify viable opportunities
3. **Acquisition Process**: Underwriting, offer generation, negotiation, and closing
4. **Disposition Strategy**: Marketing properties to our buyers list and managing sales
5. **Operations & Handoffs**: Coordinating with Properties and BuildCo teams for rehab and construction

## Tools Used

- **Airtable CRM**: Central database for all leads, deals, and pipeline management
- **PhoneBurner**: Power dialing and call management system
- **Deal Analyzer Tools**: ARV calculators, comps analysis, and underwriting spreadsheets
- **Communication Platforms**: SMS, email, and call tracking systems

## Role Responsibilities

- **Sales Acquisition Representatives (SARs)**: Lead qualification, initial contact, and deal sourcing
- **Acquisitions Team**: Underwriting, offer strategy, and deal negotiation
- **Dispositions Team**: Buyer management, deal packet creation, and sales execution
- **Operations**: Workflow coordination, handoffs, and process optimization

## KPIs or SLAs

- **Lead Response Time**: < 5 minutes for inbound leads
- **Qualification Rate**: Target 30%+ of contacted leads move to underwriting
- **Deal Close Rate**: Target 15-20% of qualified leads result in closed acquisitions
- **Disposition Timeline**: Average 30-45 days from acquisition to sale
- **Pipeline Health**: Maintain 3-6 months of deal flow at all times

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: New Lead Intake**
A homeowner submits a web form requesting a cash offer. The lead is immediately assigned to a SAR who makes first contact within 5 minutes, qualifies the property, and routes qualified leads to acquisitions for underwriting.

**Scenario 2: Deal Acquisition**
Acquisitions team receives a qualified lead, runs comps analysis, calculates ARV, determines rehab costs, and generates an offer. After negotiation, the deal closes and is handed off to Properties team for rehab planning.

**Scenario 3: Property Disposition**
A rehabbed property is ready for sale. Dispositions team creates a deal packet, contacts buyers from our curated list, manages showings, negotiates offers, and closes the sale.
