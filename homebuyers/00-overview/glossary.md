## Intro

This glossary provides standardized definitions for all terms, acronyms, and concepts used throughout the Everyday Homebuyers workstream. Consistent terminology ensures clear communication, reduces confusion, and enables efficient onboarding. All team members should reference this document when encountering unfamiliar terms or when creating new documentation.

## Purpose

Establish a single source of truth for all terminology used in the Homebuyers workstream. This prevents miscommunication, ensures consistency across documents, and accelerates new team member onboarding.

## When This Applies

- Onboarding new team members
- Writing or updating documentation
- Clarifying terms during team discussions
- Creating training materials
- Standardizing communication with external partners

## Process / Framework / Workflow

Terms are organized alphabetically. Each entry includes:
- **Term**: The word or acronym
- **Definition**: Clear, concise explanation
- **Context**: Where/how it's typically used
- **Related Terms**: Links to related concepts

## Tools Used

- This document serves as the reference tool
- Terms should be linked from other documents when first introduced
- Regular review and updates as new terms emerge

## Role Responsibilities

- **All Team Members**: Use terms consistently and suggest additions when needed
- **Documentation Authors**: Link to glossary when introducing new terms
- **Training Team**: Ensure new hires understand key terms
- **Process Owners**: Update glossary when introducing new concepts

## KPIs or SLAs

- **Terminology Consistency**: 100% of documents use glossary-defined terms correctly
- **Onboarding Speed**: New team members understand key terms within first week
- **Update Frequency**: Glossary reviewed quarterly for accuracy and completeness

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: New Team Member**
A new SAR encounters "ARV" in training materials. They reference the glossary, understand it means "After Repair Value," and can now follow acquisition discussions.

**Scenario 2: Process Documentation**
A team member documents a new workflow and uses the term "deal packet." They verify the glossary has this term defined and link to it in their document.

**Scenario 3: Cross-Team Communication**
Properties team uses "rehab scope" in a handoff. Homebuyers team references glossary to ensure both teams use the term consistently.
