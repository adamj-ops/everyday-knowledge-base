## Intro

Escalation Rules define when and how to escalate issues, decisions, or situations that fall outside standard procedures or require higher-level input. Clear escalation rules ensure issues are resolved promptly, decisions are made at appropriate levels, and team members know when and how to seek help. Effective escalation prevents bottlenecks, maintains quality, and protects the business.
