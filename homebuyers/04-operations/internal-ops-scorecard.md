## Intro

The Internal Ops Scorecard provides a comprehensive dashboard of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for the Everyday Homebuyers workstream. This scorecard enables data-driven decision-making, performance monitoring, and continuous improvement. Regular review of the scorecard identifies trends, issues, and opportunities for optimization.

## Purpose

Establish a standardized scorecard that tracks critical performance metrics across all workstream functions, enabling monitoring, analysis, and improvement. This ensures data-driven operations and continuous optimization.

## When This Applies

- Weekly/monthly performance reviews
- Identifying performance issues or trends
- Setting performance targets
- Analyzing workstream effectiveness
- Planning improvements and optimizations

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Weekly Review**
Operations generates weekly scorecard. Review shows lead response time at 6 minutes (above 5-minute target). Analyze root cause: system delays. Implement fix: optimize notification system. Next week: response time improves to 4 minutes. Target met.

**Scenario 2: Monthly Trend Analysis**
Monthly review shows declining offer acceptance rate (12% vs 15% target). Analyze: offers may be too low, market conditions changed. Adjust offer strategy: position offers slightly higher. Monitor results. Acceptance rate improves to 17%. Target met.

**Scenario 3: Performance Issue**
Scorecard shows handoff completion rate at 85% (below 100% target). Identify issue: incomplete handoff documentation. Implement fix: improve handoff checklist, add training. Monitor: completion rate improves to 98%. Target nearly met, continue improvement.
