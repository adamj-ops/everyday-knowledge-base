## Intro

The Workflow Map provides a visual and textual representation of how work flows through the Everyday Homebuyers workstream, from lead generation through property disposition. This map shows handoff points, decision gates, and process dependencies, enabling team members to understand their role in the broader system and identify optimization opportunities.

## Purpose

Document the complete workflow from lead to sale, including all stages, handoffs, and decision points. This enables process understanding, identifies bottlenecks, and supports continuous improvement.

## When This Applies

- Understanding the complete workstream flow
- Onboarding new team members
- Identifying process bottlenecks
- Planning process improvements
- Coordinating cross-team handoffs

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### Workflow Stages

**Stage 1: Lead Generation**
- Inbound leads (web forms, referrals)
- Outbound leads (cold outreach, marketing)
- Lead enters CRM system
- **Handoff:** Lead Management

**Stage 2: Lead Qualification**
- SAR contacts lead (5-minute SLA)
- Qualification conversation
- Data entry into CRM
- Qualification decision
- **Decision Gate:** Qualified or Not Qualified
- **If Qualified:** Handoff to Acquisitions
- **If Not Qualified:** Close gracefully or follow-up

**Stage 3: Underwriting**
- Acquisitions receives qualified lead
- Property research and analysis
- Comps analysis and ARV calculation
- Repair cost estimation
- MAO calculation
- Deal viability decision
- **Decision Gate:** Proceed or Pass
- **If Proceed:** Generate offer
- **If Pass:** Close deal, document reason

**Stage 4: Offer & Negotiation**
- Offer generation and presentation
- Homeowner response
- Negotiation process
- **Decision Gate:** Accepted or Rejected
- **If Accepted:** Proceed to closing
- **If Rejected:** Close deal or re-engage

**Stage 5: Closing**
- Purchase agreement execution
- Title work and due diligence
- Closing coordination
- **Handoff:** Properties team (if rehab needed) or Dispositions (if ready to sell)

**Stage 6: Property Rehab (If Needed)**
- Properties team receives property
- Rehab planning and execution
- Quality control and completion
- **Handoff:** Dispositions team

**Stage 7: Disposition**
- Dispositions receives property
- Deal packet creation
- Buyer outreach and marketing
- Offer receipt and evaluation
- Negotiation and acceptance
- Closing coordination
- **Final Stage:** Property sold

### Key Handoff Points

**Handoff 1: Lead Management → Acquisitions**
- **Trigger:** Lead qualified
- **Deliverable:** Qualified lead with complete information
- **SLA:** Within 1 hour of qualification
- **Information Required:** Property details, seller situation, motivation, timeline

**Handoff 2: Acquisitions → Properties**
- **Trigger:** Deal closed, property needs rehab
- **Deliverable:** Property with condition report and rehab scope
- **SLA:** Within 24 hours of closing
- **Information Required:** Property condition, repair estimates, rehab priorities, timeline

**Handoff 3: Acquisitions → Dispositions**
- **Trigger:** Deal closed, property ready to sell (no rehab needed)
- **Deliverable:** Property details and acquisition information
- **SLA:** Within 24 hours of closing
- **Information Required:** Property details, acquisition cost, target sale price, timeline

**Handoff 4: Properties → Dispositions**
- **Trigger:** Rehab completed, property ready for sale
- **Deliverable:** Rehabbed property with updated condition
- **SLA:** Within 24 hours of rehab completion
- **Information Required:** Rehab details, updated condition, final costs, ready for sale confirmation

### Decision Gates

**Gate 1: Qualification**
- **Criteria:** Property in target market, seller motivated, viable opportunity
- **Decision:** Qualified → Acquisitions, Not Qualified → Close

**Gate 2: Deal Viability**
- **Criteria:** MAO positive, profit margin acceptable, risks manageable
- **Decision:** Proceed → Offer, Pass → Close

**Gate 3: Offer Acceptance**
- **Criteria:** Terms acceptable, within MAO, deal makes sense
- **Decision:** Accepted → Closing, Rejected → Close or Re-engage

**Gate 4: Rehab Decision**
- **Criteria:** Property needs rehab, rehab makes sense financially
- **Decision:** Rehab Needed → Properties, No Rehab → Dispositions

### Process Dependencies

**Critical Path:**
- Lead → Qualification → Underwriting → Offer → Closing → Disposition
- Each stage depends on previous stage completion
- Delays cascade through process

**Parallel Processes:**
- Multiple leads can be in qualification simultaneously
- Multiple properties can be in underwriting simultaneously
- Rehab and disposition planning can occur in parallel

**Bottleneck Identification:**
- Monitor time in each stage
- Identify stages with longest duration
- Focus improvement efforts on bottlenecks

## Tools Used

- **Workflow Mapping Tools**: Visual workflow diagrams
- **CRM System**: Track workflow progress and handoffs
- **Process Analytics**: Measure stage durations and bottlenecks
- **Documentation Tools**: Process documentation and updates

## Role Responsibilities

**Operations Team**
- Maintain workflow map accuracy
- Monitor workflow performance
- Identify bottlenecks and issues
- Coordinate handoffs
- Optimize processes

**All Team Members**
- Understand workflow and their role
- Complete handoffs properly
- Meet SLA timeframes
- Document issues and improvements

## KPIs or SLAs

- **End-to-End Time**: Average time from lead to sale
- **Stage Duration**: Average time in each stage
- **Handoff Efficiency**: 95%+ of handoffs completed within SLA
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Regular analysis of stage durations

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Standard Flow**
Lead enters Monday. Qualified Tuesday. Underwriting completed Wednesday. Offer presented Thursday. Accepted Friday. Closing in 21 days. Handed off to Properties for rehab. Rehab completed in 30 days. Handed off to Dispositions. Sold in 35 days. Total: ~90 days from lead to sale.

**Scenario 2: Fast-Track Flow**
High-value, motivated seller. Lead qualified same day. Underwriting expedited, completed same day. Offer presented and accepted same day. Fast-track closing in 14 days. Property needs minimal work, goes directly to Dispositions. Sold in 21 days. Total: ~35 days from lead to sale.

**Scenario 3: Bottleneck Scenario**
Multiple properties in rehab, limited capacity. Dispositions ready to sell but waiting on Properties. Identified bottleneck, prioritize high-value properties, optimize rehab process. Reduce bottleneck impact.
