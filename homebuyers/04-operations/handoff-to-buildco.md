## Intro

The Handoff to BuildCo process ensures smooth transfer of properties requiring major rehabilitation or new construction from Acquisitions or Properties to the BuildCo team. This handoff includes comprehensive property information, construction scope, and coordination details to enable efficient construction planning and execution. Effective handoffs prevent delays, ensure quality, and maintain project momentum.

## Purpose

Establish a standardized handoff process for properties requiring major construction work, ensuring BuildCo receives complete information needed to plan and execute construction projects efficiently. This enables seamless transitions and optimal construction outcomes.

## When This Applies

- Property requires major rehabilitation (>$50k)
- Property needs new construction or additions
- Transferring property to BuildCo for construction
- Coordinating construction planning and execution

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### Handoff Trigger

**When Handoff Occurs:**
- Property identified as requiring major construction
- Construction scope exceeds Properties team capacity
- BuildCo expertise needed for project
- **Decision Gate:** Acquisitions or Properties determines BuildCo handoff needed
- **Timeline:** As soon as construction need identified

- **Project Completion**: Construction completed within timeline and budget

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Major Rehab Handoff**
Property requires $75k in repairs, exceeds Properties capacity. Acquisitions identifies need, prepares BuildCo handoff. Transfers property with detailed scope and budget. BuildCo reviews, develops plan, begins construction. Project completed successfully.

**Scenario 2: New Construction Handoff**
Property has addition planned, requires BuildCo expertise. Properties prepares handoff with architectural plans and requirements. BuildCo reviews, develops construction plan, obtains permits, begins work. Addition completed successfully.

**Scenario 3: Complex Project Handoff**
Property has multiple construction phases, complex requirements. Detailed handoff prepared, meeting scheduled with BuildCo. Review scope together, discuss challenges, develop phased approach. Construction proceeds successfully.
