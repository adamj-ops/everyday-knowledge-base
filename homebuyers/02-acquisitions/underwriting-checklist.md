## When This Applies

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Standard Underwriting**
Acquisitions specialist receives qualified lead. Completes checklist systematically: verifies property info, runs comps analysis, estimates repairs, calculates MAO. All items checked, documentation complete. Decision: Proceed with offer. Offer generated and presented.

**Scenario 2: Complex Property**
Property has unique features, limited comps. Specialist completes checklist but notes challenges. Gets manager support for comps analysis. Uses alternative valuation methods. Completes all checklist items with notes on methodology. Decision: Proceed with conservative offer.

**Scenario 3: Quick Pass**
Property clearly outside target market, unrealistic seller expectations. Specialist completes initial checklist items quickly, identifies deal-breaker early. Documents rationale, makes decision to pass. Saves time by not completing full analysis.
