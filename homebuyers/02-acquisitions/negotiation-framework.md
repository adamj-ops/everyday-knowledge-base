## Intro

The Negotiation Framework provides a systematic approach to negotiating purchase terms with homeowners, balancing deal acquisition with profit protection. Effective negotiation maximizes acceptance rates while maintaining profitability, builds trust with homeowners, and ensures smooth transitions to closing. This framework guides acquisitions specialists through negotiation scenarios with clear strategies and decision-making criteria.

## Purpose

Establish a framework for conducting effective negotiations that balance competitive positioning with profit margins. This ensures consistent, strategic negotiation approaches and enables data-driven optimization.

## When This Applies

- Negotiating purchase terms after initial offer
- Handling counter-offers from homeowners
- Resolving deal issues during negotiation
- Training acquisitions team on negotiation
- Optimizing negotiation strategies

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### Negotiation Principles

**1. Know Your Limits**
- Absolute maximum: MAO (Maximum Allowable Offer)
- Never exceed MAO for emotional reasons
- Know your walk-away point before starting

**2. Understand Their Priorities**
- Price is primary, but not always only factor
- Speed, simplicity, certainty also matter
- Understand what's most important to them

**3. Create Value, Don't Just Give It Away**
- Use terms as negotiation tools
- Closing timeline flexibility
- Contingencies and conditions
- Creative solutions

**4. Build Trust**
- Be honest and transparent
- Keep commitments
- Communicate clearly and promptly
- Show genuine interest in helping

**5. Maintain Momentum**
- Respond promptly to counter-offers
- Keep process moving forward
- Don't let deals stall unnecessarily

### Negotiation Process

**Step 1: Initial Offer Presentation**
- Present offer clearly
- Explain methodology
- Set expectations
- Establish response deadline

**Step 2: Response Handling**
- Listen to their response
- Understand their concerns
- Identify their priorities
- Assess their motivation level

**Step 3: Counter-Offer Evaluation**
- Evaluate their counter-offer
- Compare to your MAO
- Assess if within your range
- Determine if deal is viable

**Step 4: Strategic Response**
- Don't jump to MAO immediately
- Make calculated counter-offer
- Use terms as leverage
- Show movement but protect margin

**Step 5: Final Agreement**
- When terms are acceptable, confirm quickly
- Execute purchase agreement promptly
- Set clear closing timeline
- Maintain momentum to closing

### Negotiation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Anchoring**
- Start with initial offer (anchor)
- Their counter will be relative to anchor
- Lower anchor = more negotiation room
- Higher anchor = less room but better starting point

**Strategy 2: Incremental Moves**
- Move in small increments (2-5%)
- Don't make large jumps
- Shows you're serious but have limits
- Makes final agreement feel like win for them

**Strategy 3: Terms as Leverage**
- Use closing timeline as negotiation tool
- Faster close = can justify higher price
- Slower close = more time for due diligence
- Contingencies can be negotiated

**Strategy 4: Package Deals**
- Negotiate multiple aspects together
- Price + timeline + terms
- Give on one, get on another
- Creates win-win perception

**Strategy 5: Walk-Away Power**
- Be willing to walk away if needed
- Don't negotiate from weakness
- Know your alternatives
- Sometimes best deal is one you don't do

### Common Negotiation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Price Counter-Offer**

**Their Counter:** "We need $10k more"

**Response Options:**
- "I understand you'd like more. Our offer is based on [methodology]. However, I can move to [amount] if we can [condition: close faster, as-is, etc.]. Does that work?"
- "I appreciate that. Based on our analysis, [amount] is our maximum. We can offer [terms: faster close, cash, etc.]. Would that help make it work?"

**Scenario 2: Timeline Negotiation**

**Their Request:** "We need 60 days to close"

**Response Options:**
- "I understand you need more time. We typically close in 14-30 days, but we can work with 60 days if we adjust the price slightly to account for holding costs. Does that make sense?"
- "We can accommodate 60 days. To make that work, we'd need to adjust the offer to [amount] to account for the extended timeline. Is that acceptable?"

**Scenario 3: Repair Negotiation**

**Their Request:** "Can you help with repairs?"

**Response Options:**
- "We buy properties as-is, which is part of how we can offer cash and close quickly. However, we can adjust our offer to account for repairs you'd like to handle. Would that work?"
- "We typically handle all repairs after purchase. If you'd prefer to handle repairs, we can adjust our offer accordingly. What did you have in mind?"

**Scenario 4: Multiple Offers**

**Situation:** "We have another offer"

**Response Options:**
- "I understand you're exploring options. Our offer is [strengths: cash, fast close, no contingencies]. We can move quickly if you're ready to move forward. What would it take to work with us?"
- "That's great you have options. We'd love to work with you. Our offer is competitive, and we can [flexibility: close faster, adjust terms, etc.]. What's most important to you in this decision?"

### Objection Handling

**"Your offer is too low"**
- Acknowledge their concern
- Explain methodology (comps, repairs, etc.)
- Show them the numbers
- Emphasize value of speed and simplicity
- "I understand. Let me show you how we arrived at this number..."

**"We can get more listing it"**
- Acknowledge they might get more
- But emphasize costs: agent fees, repairs, time, uncertainty
- Show them net proceeds comparison
- "You're right, you might get more. But after agent fees, repairs, and time, our offer might actually net you more..."

**"We need to think about it"**
- Understand, but set deadline
- Offer to answer questions
- Provide information to help decision
- "Absolutely, I understand. Can I answer any questions? And when would be a good time to follow up?"

**"We're working with someone else"**
- Acknowledge, don't pressure
- Emphasize your strengths
- Offer to be backup option
- "I understand. We're here if that doesn't work out. Our offer stands, and we can move quickly if needed."

### Walk-Away Decision

**When to Walk Away:**
- Counter-offer exceeds MAO
- Terms are unacceptable
- Seller is unreasonable or difficult
- Deal risks are too high
- Better opportunities available

**How to Walk Away:**
- Be respectful and professional
- Explain why it doesn't work
- Leave door open for future
- "I appreciate your time. Unfortunately, [amount/terms] doesn't work for us based on our analysis. If your situation changes, please reach out. Best of luck!"

**After Walking Away:**
- Document why deal didn't work
- Learn from experience
- Don't second-guess good decisions
- Move on to next opportunity

## Tools Used

- **Negotiation Tracker**: Document negotiation points and progress
- **Offer Calculator**: Calculate counter-offers and terms
- **MAO Calculator**: Know your limits
- **CRM System**: Track negotiation history
- **Communication Tools**: Phone, email, text for negotiation

## Role Responsibilities

**Acquisitions Specialists**
- Follow negotiation framework
- Know limits and walk-away points
- Respond promptly to counter-offers
- Document negotiation progress
- Escalate when needed

**Acquisitions Manager**
- Review negotiation strategies
- Provide guidance on difficult deals
- Approve deals near MAO
- Analyze negotiation performance
- Train team on framework

## KPIs or SLAs

- **Negotiation Success Rate**: 60%+ of accepted offers close
- **Average Negotiation Time**: 1-7 days typical
- **Price Movement**: Track average movement from initial to final
- **Deal Quality**: Profit margins maintained through negotiation

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Successful Negotiation**
Initial offer: $120k. Seller counters: $135k. We counter: $125k with faster close. Seller counters: $130k. We counter: $127.5k, final offer. Seller accepts. Deal closed successfully.

**Scenario 2: Walk-Away**
Initial offer: $150k (MAO is $155k). Seller counters: $165k. We explain our maximum is $155k. Seller insists on $165k. We walk away respectfully. Better to pass than overpay.

**Scenario 3: Creative Solution**
Price gap exists, but seller needs fast close and we can accommodate. We offer higher price ($5k more) in exchange for 14-day close and as-is condition. Seller accepts. Win-win solution.
