## Intro

The Offer Strategy Framework provides a systematic approach to determining initial offer amounts, planning negotiation room, and positioning offers for maximum acceptance rates while maintaining profitability. This framework balances competitive positioning with profit margins, ensuring we win deals at prices that enable successful dispositions. Effective offer strategy directly impacts deal conversion rates and overall business performance.

## Purpose

Establish a framework for developing offer strategies that maximize acceptance rates while protecting profit margins. This ensures consistent, strategic offer positioning across all deals and enables data-driven optimization of offer strategies.

## When This Applies

- Developing offers for qualified properties
- Planning negotiation strategies
- Analyzing offer performance and conversion rates
- Training acquisitions team on offer positioning
- Optimizing offer strategies based on market conditions

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### Offer Strategy Components

**1. Base Calculation**
- Start with MAO (Maximum Allowable Offer)
- MAO = ARV - Repair Costs - Holding Costs - Desired Profit - Closing Costs
- This is the absolute maximum we can offer

**2. Initial Offer Positioning**
- Typically start 5-15% below MAO
- Factors affecting positioning:
  - Market competitiveness
  - Seller motivation level
  - Property condition
  - Time on market (if listed)
  - Our deal pipeline (can we be more aggressive?)

**3. Negotiation Room**
- Plan how much we can move from initial offer
- Typically 5-10% negotiation room
- Know walk-away point (MAO)
- Understand what terms we can adjust

**4. Terms Strategy**
- Price is primary, but terms matter
- Closing timeline flexibility
- Contingencies (minimize when possible)
- Special conditions (as-is, quick close, etc.)

### Offer Positioning Matrix

| Seller Motivation | Market Competition | Initial Offer % of MAO | Negotiation Room |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Very High         | Low               | 85-90%               | 5%               |
| High              | Low               | 80-85%               | 5-10%            |
| High              | High              | 75-80%               | 10-15%           |
| Medium            | Low               | 70-75%               | 10-15%           |
| Medium            | High              | 65-70%               | 15-20%           |
| Low               | Any               | 60-65%               | 15-20%           |

### Strategic Considerations

**Market Conditions:**
- Hot market: May need to be more aggressive (higher initial offer)
- Cold market: Can be more conservative (lower initial offer)
- Balanced market: Standard positioning

**Property Factors:**
- Turnkey properties: Less negotiation room (seller knows value)
- Needs significant repairs: More negotiation room (seller aware of condition)
- Unique properties: Conservative positioning (harder to value)

**Deal Pipeline:**
- Strong pipeline: Can be more selective, lower offers
- Weak pipeline: May need to be more aggressive, higher offers
- Target volume: Adjust strategy to meet volume goals

**Seller Situation:**
- Foreclosure: Can be more aggressive (time pressure)
- Relocation: Moderate positioning
- Investment property: More negotiation room (business decision)
- Inherited property: Varies by situation

### Offer Presentation Strategy

**Opening:**
- Acknowledge their situation
- Explain our process briefly
- Set expectations

**Offer Explanation:**
- Show how we arrived at offer
- Reference comps and market data
- Explain repair costs (if relevant)
- Emphasize value of speed and simplicity

**Positioning:**
- Frame offer as fair market value
- Highlight benefits (cash, speed, no repairs)
- Address potential objections proactively

**Closing:**
- Set clear response deadline
- Offer to answer questions
- Express genuine interest in helping

### Negotiation Strategy

**Initial Response Handling:**
- Listen to their concerns
- Understand their priorities (price, speed, simplicity)
- Address objections with data and logic
- Don't move immediately (shows we have room)

**Counter-Offer Strategy:**
- Evaluate their counter-offer
- Determine if within our range
- Make strategic counter (don't jump to MAO immediately)
- Use terms as negotiation tools (timeline, contingencies)

**Walk-Away Decision:**
- Know your absolute maximum (MAO)
- Don't exceed MAO for emotional reasons
- Walk away gracefully if needed
- Leave door open for future (situations change)

**Deal Closing:**
- When agreement reached, confirm quickly
- Execute purchase agreement promptly
- Set clear closing timeline
- Maintain momentum to closing

## Tools Used

- **Offer Calculator**: Spreadsheet or software for offer calculations
- **Market Data**: Comps, market trends, competition analysis
- **Deal Analyzer**: Comprehensive underwriting tool
- **Negotiation Tracker**: Document negotiation points and progress
- **Performance Analytics**: Track offer acceptance rates by strategy

## Role Responsibilities

**Acquisitions Specialists**
- Apply offer strategy framework consistently
- Position offers strategically based on factors
- Execute negotiation according to plan
- Document strategy and outcomes
- Learn from each deal

**Acquisitions Manager**
- Review offer strategies for key deals
- Provide guidance on positioning
- Analyze performance data
- Optimize framework based on results
- Train team on framework

## KPIs or SLAs

- **Offer Acceptance Rate**: Target 15-20% of offers accepted
- **Negotiation Success**: 60%+ of accepted offers close
- **Average Negotiation Room Used**: Track how much room is typically needed
- **Profit Margin**: Average profit margin meets targets
- **Time to Acceptance**: Average time from offer to acceptance

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: High Motivation, Low Competition**
Seller needs to relocate in 30 days, property needs $20k repairs, no other offers. MAO is $150k. Position initial offer at 85% of MAO = $127.5k. Seller counters at $140k. We counter at $135k. Seller accepts. Deal closed successfully.

**Scenario 2: Medium Motivation, High Competition**
Property listed, multiple interested parties, seller not urgent. MAO is $200k. Position initial offer at 70% of MAO = $140k (aggressive to compete). Seller counters at $180k. We counter at $160k. Seller accepts competitor's offer at $175k. We learn and adjust for next deal.

**Scenario 3: Foreclosure Situation**
Foreclosure sale in 3 weeks, seller very motivated. MAO is $120k. Position initial offer at 90% of MAO = $108k (aggressive due to time pressure). Seller accepts immediately. Fast-track closing in 14 days.
