## Intro

After Repair Value (ARV) is the estimated market value of a property after all repairs and renovations are completed. Accurate ARV calculation is critical for determining Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO) and ensuring profitable acquisitions. This guide provides systematic methods for calculating ARV using comparable sales analysis, market data, and property-specific factors.

## Purpose

Establish standardized methodology for calculating ARV that ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability. This enables confident offer generation and protects profit margins.

## When This Applies

- Calculating ARV for any property acquisition
- Validating property values
- Training acquisitions team on ARV calculation
- Reviewing ARV accuracy and methodology
- Optimizing valuation processes

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### ARV Definition

**ARV (After Repair Value):**
The estimated market value of a property after all necessary repairs, renovations, and improvements are completed, assuming the property is in good, marketable condition.

**Key Principles:**
- ARV reflects market value, not our purchase price
- ARV assumes property is repaired and ready for sale
- ARV should be conservative (use lower end of range)
- ARV is based on comparable sales, not wishful thinking

### ARV Calculation Methods

**Method 1: Comparable Sales Analysis (Primary Method)**

**Step 1: Identify Comparable Properties**
- Find 3-5 properties sold in last 6 months
- Similar size, type, location, condition (after repairs)
- Within 1 mile radius, same neighborhood preferred

**Step 2: Adjust Comps to Subject Property**
- Adjust for size differences (price per sq ft)
- Adjust for condition (assume repairs complete)
- Adjust for features (garage, updates, etc.)
- Adjust for location differences
- Adjust for market timing

**Step 3: Calculate Adjusted Values**
- Each comp adjusted to match subject
- Document all adjustments and rationale

**Step 4: Determine ARV**
- Average of adjusted comp values
- Or use price per square foot method
- Result is ARV estimate

**Example:**
- Comp 1: Sold $180k, 1,600 sq ft, adjusted to subject = $175k
- Comp 2: Sold $185k, 1,550 sq ft, adjusted to subject = $178k
- Comp 3: Sold $170k, 1,500 sq ft, adjusted to subject = $172k
- ARV = ($175k + $178k + $172k) / 3 = $175k

**Method 2: Price Per Square Foot**

**Step 1: Calculate $/Sq Ft for Comps**
- Divide sale price by square footage for each comp
- Example: $180k / 1,600 sq ft = $112.50/sq ft

**Step 2: Average $/Sq Ft**
- Average the $/sq ft from all comps
- Example: $112.50, $115.00, $110.00 = $112.50/sq ft average

**Step 3: Apply to Subject**
- Multiply average $/sq ft by subject square footage
- Example: $112.50 × 1,500 sq ft = $168,750 ARV

**Method 3: Cost Approach (Secondary Method)**

**Step 1: Determine Land Value**
- Research land values in area
- Or use percentage of total value (typically 15-25%)

**Step 2: Calculate Replacement Cost**
- Cost to build similar property new
- Use local construction cost data
- Adjust for depreciation

**Step 3: Add Land Value**
- Replacement cost + land value = total value
- Adjust for market conditions

**Note:** Cost approach is less reliable for ARV, use as validation only.

**Method 4: Income Approach (For Rental Properties)**

**Step 1: Determine Market Rent**
- Research comparable rental rates
- Calculate annual rental income

**Step 2: Apply Cap Rate**
- Use market cap rates for area
- Cap rate typically 5-10% for residential

**Step 3: Calculate Value**
- Value = Annual Income / Cap Rate
- Example: $18,000 annual rent / 8% cap = $225k value

**Note:** Income approach primarily for rental properties, use as validation.

### ARV Range Calculation

**Conservative ARV:**
- Use lower end of comp range
- Apply conservative adjustments
- Account for market uncertainty
- Use for MAO calculation (protects profit)

**Optimistic ARV:**
- Use higher end of comp range
- Apply favorable adjustments
- Assume best-case scenario
- Use for planning purposes only

**ARV Range Example:**
- Conservative: $170k
- Most Likely: $175k
- Optimistic: $180k
- **Use $170k for MAO calculation**

### Factors Affecting ARV

**Property Factors:**
- Size (square footage)
- Condition (after repairs)
- Features (garage, updates, layout)
- Lot size and characteristics
- Age and construction quality

**Location Factors:**
- Neighborhood desirability
- School district quality
- Proximity to amenities
- Crime rates
- Future development plans

**Market Factors:**
- Current market conditions
- Supply and demand
- Interest rates
- Economic trends
- Seasonal factors

**Adjustment Guidelines:**

| Factor | Adjustment Range |
|--------|-----------------|
| Square Footage | $80-150/sq ft (market dependent) |
| Condition (Excellent) | +$5-10k |
| Condition (Good) | +$0-5k |
| Condition (Fair) | $0 (baseline) |
| Condition (Poor) | -$5-15k |
| Garage (2-car) | +$10-20k |
| Updated Kitchen | +$5-15k |
| Updated Bathrooms | +$3-10k |
| Finished Basement | +$15-30k |
| Better Neighborhood | +$10-30k |
| Worse Neighborhood | -$10-30k |

### Quality Checks

**ARV Validation:**
- ✅ ARV aligns with market trends
- ✅ ARV is supported by multiple comps
- ✅ Adjustments are reasonable
- ✅ ARV range is not too wide (±5-10%)
- ✅ ARV makes sense for area and property type

**Red Flags:**
- ⚠️ ARV seems too high or too low
- ⚠️ Limited comps support ARV
- ⚠️ Large adjustments needed
- ⚠️ ARV doesn't align with market data
- ⚠️ Subject property is unique/unusual

**When to Get Help:**
- ARV seems uncertain
- Limited comps available
- Property is unique
- Large adjustments needed
- Manager review recommended

### Documentation Requirements

**Document:**
- Comps used and why
- All adjustments made
- ARV calculation methodology
- ARV range (conservative to optimistic)
- Confidence level in ARV
- Any concerns or uncertainties
- Supporting data and sources

## Tools Used

- **Comps Analysis Tools**: MLS, public records, real estate websites
- **ARV Calculator**: Spreadsheet or software tool
- **Market Data**: Market trends, neighborhood data
- **Valuation Software**: Automated valuation models (for validation)
- **Mapping Tools**: Location analysis

## Role Responsibilities

**Acquisitions Specialists**
- Calculate ARV accurately and consistently
- Use conservative ARV for MAO
- Document methodology completely
- Seek help when uncertain
- Validate ARV reasonableness

**Acquisitions Manager**
- Review ARV calculations
- Provide guidance on difficult cases
- Ensure methodology consistency
- Validate ARV accuracy over time
- Train team on best practices

## KPIs or SLAs

- **ARV Accuracy**: Within 5% of actual sale price (when verified)
- **ARV Calculation Time**: 30-45 minutes per property
- **ARV Confidence**: 90%+ of ARVs have high confidence
- **Profit Projection Accuracy**: ARV-based profit projections within 10% of actual

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Standard ARV Calculation**
Property: 1,500 sq ft, 3BR/2BA, needs $20k repairs. Find 4 comps, adjust for size and features. Calculate ARV: $175k (conservative). Use for MAO: $175k - $20k repairs - $15k profit - $5k costs = $135k MAO.

**Scenario 2: Unique Property**
Property has unusual features, limited comps. Use best available comps, make larger adjustments. Calculate ARV range: $180k-$200k. Use conservative $180k. Document uncertainty, get manager approval.

**Scenario 3: Hot Market**
Market is appreciating rapidly. Recent comps may be outdated. Adjust for market appreciation (2% per month). Calculate ARV accounting for market trends. Use conservative estimate to protect against market changes.
