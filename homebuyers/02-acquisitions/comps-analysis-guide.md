## Intro

Comparable sales analysis (comps) is the foundation of accurate property valuation and ARV determination. This guide provides systematic methods for identifying, analyzing, and adjusting comparable properties to determine accurate After Repair Value (ARV). Effective comps analysis ensures we make offers based on realistic market values, protecting profit margins and deal viability.

## Purpose

Provide comprehensive guidance on conducting thorough, accurate comparable sales analysis. This ensures consistent valuation methodology and enables data-driven acquisition decisions.

## When This Applies

- Underwriting any property acquisition
- Determining ARV for offer calculations
- Validating property values
- Training acquisitions team on valuation
- Reviewing and improving comps analysis quality

## Process / Framework / Workflow

### Comps Selection Criteria

**Ideal Comps:**
- Sold within last 6 months (preferred) or 12 months (acceptable)
- Within 1 mile radius (preferred) or same neighborhood
- Similar square footage (±20%)
- Similar property type (single family, multi-family, etc.)
- Similar lot size (±25%)
- Similar age (±10 years)
- Similar condition (after repairs, for ARV)

**Minimum Requirements:**
- At least 3 comps (prefer 5+)
- At least 1 comp within last 3 months
- At least 2 comps within 1 mile
- Similar property characteristics

### Comps Identification Process

**Step 1: Define Subject Property**
- Address and location
- Square footage
- Bedrooms and bathrooms
- Lot size
- Property type
- Condition (after repairs)
- Key features (garage, updates, etc.)

**Step 2: Search for Comps**
- Use MLS (if available)
- Public records databases
- Real estate websites
- County assessor records
- Real estate agent networks

**Step 3: Initial Filtering**
- Filter by sale date (last 6-12 months)
- Filter by location (same neighborhood/area)
- Filter by property type
- Filter by size range

**Step 4: Detailed Review**
- Review each potential comp
- Verify sale price and date
- Check property details
- Assess similarity to subject
- Identify key differences

**Step 5: Select Final Comps**
- Choose 3-5 best comps
- Prioritize most similar and recent
- Ensure geographic diversity if needed
- Document why each comp was selected

### Comps Analysis Framework

**Data to Collect for Each Comp:**
- Sale price
- Sale date
- Square footage
- Bedrooms/bathrooms
- Lot size
- Property type
- Condition at sale
- Key features
- Location (address, neighborhood)
- Days on market
- Any special circumstances

### Adjustment Methodology

**Adjustments Needed For:**
1. **Size Differences**
   - Price per square foot method
   - Adjust for square footage difference
   - Example: Comp is 1,500 sq ft, subject is 1,400 sq ft
   - If comp sold for $180k ($120/sq ft), adjust: 1,400 × $120 = $168k

2. **Condition Differences**
   - Adjust for condition (after repairs)
   - Typical adjustments:
     - Excellent condition: +$0-5k
     - Good condition: +$0-3k
     - Fair condition: $0 (baseline)
     - Poor condition: -$5-15k

3. **Feature Differences**
   - Garage: +$5-15k
   - Updated kitchen: +$5-10k
   - Updated bathrooms: +$3-8k
   - Finished basement: +$10-20k
   - Pool: +$10-25k (market dependent)
   - Other features as relevant

4. **Location Differences**
   - Same neighborhood: $0 adjustment
   - Better neighborhood: +$5-20k
   - Worse neighborhood: -$5-20k
   - Corner lot: +$2-5k
   - Busy street: -$5-10k

5. **Market Timing**
   - Adjust for market changes since sale
   - If market up 2% since comp sale: +2%
   - If market down: -2%
   - Use market trend data

**Adjustment Process:**
1. Start with comp sale price
2. Adjust for size difference
3. Adjust for condition
4. Adjust for features
5. Adjust for location
6. Adjust for market timing
7. Result is adjusted comp value

### ARV Calculation

**Method 1: Average of Adjusted Comps**
- Adjust all comps to subject property
- Average the adjusted values
- This is your ARV estimate
- Example: Adjusted comps = $175k, $180k, $170k
- ARV = ($175k + $180k + $170k) / 3 = $175k

**Method 2: Price Per Square Foot**
- Calculate price per sq ft for each comp
- Average the price per sq ft
- Multiply by subject square footage
- Example: Average $/sq ft = $120
- Subject = 1,500 sq ft
- ARV = 1,500 × $120 = $180k

**Method 3: Weighted Average**
- Weight comps by:
  - Recency (more recent = higher weight)
  - Similarity (more similar = higher weight)
  - Location (closer = higher weight)
- Calculate weighted average
- Example: Recent, similar comp gets 40% weight
- Older, less similar gets 20% weight

**ARV Range:**
- Calculate conservative ARV (lower end)
- Calculate optimistic ARV (upper end)
- Use conservative for MAO calculation
- Range provides flexibility in offer strategy

### Quality Checks

**Comps Quality Indicators:**
- ✅ Multiple recent comps (3+)
- ✅ Similar properties in same area
- ✅ Adjustments are reasonable
- ✅ ARV aligns with market trends
- ✅ No outliers skewing results

**Red Flags:**
- ⚠️ Only 1-2 comps available
- ⚠️ Comps are old (>12 months)
- ⚠️ Comps are far away (>1 mile)
- ⚠️ Large adjustments needed (>20%)
- ⚠️ ARV seems unrealistic
- ⚠️ Subject property is unique

**When to Get Help:**
- Limited comps available
- Subject property is unique
- Large adjustments needed
- ARV seems uncertain
- Manager review recommended

### Documentation Requirements

**Document for Each Comp:**
- Comp address and details
- Sale price and date
- Adjustments made and rationale
- Adjusted value
- Source of comp data

**Document Overall Analysis:**
- Comps selected and why
- Adjustment methodology
- ARV calculation
- ARV range (conservative to optimistic)
- Confidence level in ARV
- Any concerns or uncertainties

## Tools Used

- **MLS Access**: Primary source for comps data
- **Public Records**: County assessor, deed records
- **Real Estate Websites**: Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com
- **Comps Analysis Spreadsheet**: Organized analysis template
- **Market Data Tools**: Market trends, neighborhood data
- **Mapping Tools**: Google Maps, GIS systems

## Role Responsibilities

**Acquisitions Specialists**
- Conduct thorough comps analysis
- Follow methodology consistently
- Document work completely
- Seek help when needed
- Maintain quality standards

**Acquisitions Manager**
- Review comps analysis quality
- Provide guidance on difficult cases
- Ensure methodology consistency
- Train team on best practices
- Optimize process based on results

## KPIs or SLAs

- **Comps Analysis Accuracy**: ARV within 5% of actual sale price (when verified)
- **Comps Analysis Time**: 30-45 minutes per property
- **Comps Quality Score**: Regular audits show high quality
- **ARV Confidence**: 90%+ of ARVs have high confidence level

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Standard Comps Analysis**
Subject: 1,500 sq ft, 3BR/2BA, needs $20k repairs. Find 4 comps sold in last 6 months, all within 0.5 miles. Adjust for size, condition, features. Calculate ARV range: $170k-$180k. Use $170k (conservative) for MAO calculation.

**Scenario 2: Limited Comps**
Subject property in unique area, only 2 recent comps found. Both are 8 months old, 0.8 miles away. Expand search to 12 months, 1.5 miles. Find 2 more comps. Adjust all 4 comps, note limitations. Calculate ARV with lower confidence, get manager review.

**Scenario 3: Unique Property**
Subject has unusual features (large lot, unique layout). Limited truly comparable sales. Use best available comps, make larger adjustments. Consider alternative valuation methods. Document uncertainty, use conservative ARV, get manager approval.
