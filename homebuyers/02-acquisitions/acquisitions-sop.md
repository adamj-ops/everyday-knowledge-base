## Intro

The Acquisitions Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides step-by-step instructions for processing qualified leads from receipt through closing. This SOP ensures consistent, thorough evaluation of every opportunity, systematic offer generation, and effective deal management. Following this SOP maximizes deal quality, minimizes errors, and ensures profitable acquisitions.

## Purpose

Establish a standardized process for acquisitions that ensures every deal is evaluated thoroughly, offers are generated accurately, and deals are managed effectively from qualification to closing. This SOP serves as the definitive guide for acquisitions team operations.

- Training new acquisitions team members
- Ensuring consistency across team members
- Auditing deal processes for quality
- Optimizing acquisitions workflows
